# Changelog

## 1.1.4 (2026-05-28)
- Reworked repository scaffolding to a top-tier standard with `.editorconfig`, `CODEOWNERS`, Dependabot, issue templates, and PR template.
- Upgraded GitHub Actions checkout to `actions/checkout@v5` to remove Node 20 deprecation warnings.
- Expanded contributing and security guidance.
- Polished README with stronger product framing, setup flow explanation, troubleshooting, quality gates, and repository standards.
- Tightened `.gitignore` for generated Omnipod helper files.

## 1.1.3 (2026-05-28)
- Upgraded installer robustness to NousResearch-grade standards.
- Added environment isolation guards (`PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONHOME`) to prevent builder shadowing.
- Switched interactive prompts to use raw TTY descriptor probes (`/dev/tty`), supporting piping via `curl | bash` safely.
- Added FHS install layout directory logic for `root` installations (`/usr/local/lib/omnipod` + `/usr/local/bin`).
- Integrated automatic login shell detection (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`) and PATH registration for bin helpers.
- Added path registration and `omnipod.cmd` wrapper script support for Windows environments.
- Implemented temporary log capture for Docker builds to report failures cleanly instead of silent aborts.

## 1.1.2 (2026-05-27)
- Fixed installer `--uninstall` / `-Uninstall` so it never bootstraps Docker before uninstall checks.
- Bound generated API port to `127.0.0.1` by default.
- Removed fixed Compose `container_name` to avoid multi-install conflicts.
- Kept generated Dockerfile browser layer default opt-in/off.
- Added uninstaller CLI flags: `--dir`, `--remove-data`, `--remove-files`.
- Hardened CI guard for uninstall mode.
- Made `--skip-build` / `-SkipBuild` skip port collision checks because no service starts.

## 1.1.1 (2026-05-27)
- Added auto-install/auto-start Docker support for Windows and Linux/macOS.
- Installer detects OS and uses appropriate method (get.docker.com, brew, winget).

## 1.0.0 (2026-05-27)
- Initial release.
